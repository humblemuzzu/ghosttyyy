# muzzpi

**pi, fully loaded.**

My harness for [pi](https://pi.dev), the terminal coding agent. Six sub-agents
that research, review and build in parallel. Web search, GitHub and screenshots
built in. Edits you can undo. A TUI made for all-day sessions, with live theme
and Ghostty previews. Everything vanilla pi leaves for you to build, already built.

pi's homepage says *"There are many agent harnesses but this one is yours."* This
one is mine. Built and used daily by [Muzzammil](https://itsmuzz.com) since March
2026.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/humblemuzzu/muzzpi.git && cd muzzpi
./install.sh pi --dry-run    # every change it would make, nothing written
./install.sh pi
```

---

## Why it exists

pi is deliberately small. Out of the box the model gets four tools (`read`,
`bash`, `edit`, `write`), and the README says it *"skips features like sub-agents
and plan mode. Ask Pi to build what you want."*

So I did. Everything here is an extension, a config file or a patch on top of
stock pi. Nothing is forked.

## What vanilla pi doesn't have

| | vanilla pi 1.1 | muzzpi |
|---|---|---|
| Tools the model gets | 4 on by default | 29 of its own, plus codemode and one lazy MCP proxy |
| Sub-agents | none, by design | 6, each with its own model and thinking level, resumable |
| Editing | `edit` + `write` | one `apply_patch`: four call shapes, all-or-nothing batches, undo/redo that refuses to clobber drift |
| Bash | timeout optional, no default | timeout required (1–600s), killed after 300s of no output and no CPU |
| Command rules | none | `permissions.json`: no `git add -A`, no force push, no `rm`, no shelling out to other agents |
| Secrets | in the clear | scrubbed from every tool result before the model sees it |
| Web | none | `web_search`, `read_web_page` with a Q&A child |
| GitHub | none | 7 tools over `gh api`: read, search, glob, list, commits, diff |
| Screen | none | `screenshot` of any window, region or URL, sized to Claude's vision limits |
| History | session picker | `search_sessions`, `read_session`, `agent_message` between live sessions |
| Session list | stock | pinning (`Ctrl+B` in `/resume`) |
| Comments | whatever the model writes | a gate that refuses a patch that is mostly commentary |

## The sub-agents

Every sub-agent is a fresh pi process with its own short prompt naming exactly
the tools it has. Pick by what you need back:

| Agent | Returns | Use it to |
|---|---|---|
| `finder` | file paths and line ranges | locate code by concept, fast |
| `chad` | an answer with `path:line` evidence, verified vs inferred | find out what is true; swarm several at once, one question each |
| `oracle` | one verdict, trade-offs, effort | decide; review a plan or a hard bug |
| `delegate` | finished work | hand off an independent task; resumable by `continueId` |
| `librarian` | an explanation across repos | read code on GitHub you have not cloned |
| `code_review` | a structured review | review a diff described in plain words |

- **chad cannot write.** No `apply_patch`, and its bash runs under an allowlist
  that refuses redirection, `sed -i`, interpreters and every git subcommand that
  mutates. Finding out is chad; doing is delegate.
- **The spawn graph is acyclic and pinned by a test.** The only agent that can
  start another is delegate (it can call finder). A chad swarm can never spawn
  its own swarm.
- **Models live in one file.** [`agent-models.json`](pi-setup/agent-models.json)
  names a short list of models and a default per agent. Say *"three chads on
  deepseek flash at medium"* and the parent passes exactly that. A model not on
  the list is refused, never swapped for the nearest one. Every result ends with
  the model and thinking level that actually ran.
- **`@oracle`, `@chad`, `@finder`, `@codereview`, `@task`** in a message force
  that agent.

## The tools

- **`apply_patch`** is the one way to change a file: whole-file writes, exact
  replacements, multi-file batches that land all-or-nothing, or a patch envelope.
  `undo_edit` / `redo_edit` walk it back, even after a restart.
- **`web_search`** and **`read_web_page`**: fetch a page, or ask a question about
  it and get an answer from a child agent.
- **7 GitHub tools** read, search and diff any repo you can see, without cloning.
- **`screenshot`** captures a window, a region of the screen or a whole web page,
  already sized for the model to read small text.
- **`search_sessions`** and **`read_session`** pull context out of any past
  conversation; **`agent_message`** sends work to another live session.
- **codemode** batches dozens of tool calls in one script, and one **`mcp`** proxy
  reaches 19 MCP servers (Chrome DevTools, Cloudflare, Paper, Astro) that only
  connect when first used.
- **12 skills** load on demand: debugging, code review, TDD, design ports, git,
  SEO data, and more.

## The TUI

- A box-drawn editor with model, context, cost and git branch on the border, and
  a cache line under it: hit rate, read/write totals, time left on the cache.
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` opens any sub-agent's live transcript.
- `/studio` previews pi themes **and** your Ghostty theme, font and opacity live.
  Esc reverts, Enter keeps.
- `/stats` (`Ctrl+Shift+S`): a nine-tab usage dashboard covering cost, tokens,
  cache hits and busts, models, tools, sub-agents, projects matched to commits,
  your work rhythm, and a wrapped card.
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` command palette, `/md` export, desktop notifications, auto-named sessions, a DeepSeek peak-pricing
  clock, and `/ysk`, an opt-in side agent that flags what you might have missed.
- Pin sessions with `Ctrl+B` in `/resume`.
- A patched pi-tui that never undercounts character widths, so Hindi, Bengali
  or emoji in tool output cannot smear the screen.

## Built to run all day

- **Nothing runs unbounded.** Three layers: a declared timeout on every command,
  an idle kill when a command stops printing and stops using CPU, and a 900s
  stall watchdog on sub-agents. A machine sleep never counts as a hang.
- **A failed command is a failure.** Exit codes and stderr reach the model as
  they happened. A package that reported failed `git add` as success was
  removed the day it was caught.
- **Images can't break a session.** Every screenshot and image read is sized to
  Claude's published vision limits before it is sent, and the harness refuses
  a call that would push the request past the API's 32 MiB ceiling. That is a
  limit pi does not check, and crossing it once means a 413 on every later turn.
- **The prompt never changes mid-session.** One mutating hook once rewrote the
  prompt cache on every turn and drained 19% of a Max plan's week in under a
  day. The system prompt and tool schemas are now frozen at session start.
- **Working rules ship in the system prompt**, not in a hook: scope, evidence,
  no comments by default, and a hard stop before anything that deletes data,
  rewrites git history or publishes.

## Things that broke

Seven months on a fast-moving agent means a lot of things broke silently. The
ones worth knowing about:

- **The cache drain.** A hook re-added a note to the message list every turn.
  83,658,669 cache-write tokens, 99% of everything metered, 19% of a $200 plan's
  week in under 24 hours. Fixed by moving the rules into the system prompt.
  The whole investigation, mistakes included:
  [cache playbook](pi-setup/2026-10-03-cache-playbook.md).
- **A pi update killed every sub-agent.** pi 0.84 made bare model ids an
  ambiguity error, and every spawn died on start. One fix at the single spawn
  point; the update workflow now calls a real sub-agent before calling it clean.
- **For months, custom tools never reached Claude.** The OAuth shim filtered out
  every tool not named like Claude Code's, so Claude wrote tool calls as plain
  text and invented the results.
- **Sub-agents asked for tools that did not exist.** `glob`, `edit_file` and
  `create_file` are not pi names, so they were dropped without a word, and the
  editing agent could not edit.
- **Hindi broke the screen.** pi-tui measured `क्त्र` as 1 column, Ghostty drew 3,
  and the whole TUI desynced. Fixed with a patch applied to every pi-tui copy
  on the machine, and a render harness to prove it.
- **3 GB of duplicates.** Three npm roots held 18 stale pi packages and 24 copies
  of pi-tui. Now there are 4, all patched, all loaded.
- **`pi update --self` silently disables every patch.** It points `pi` at a
  bundled build that ignores patched files. Updates go through
  [`update-pi.sh`](pi-setup/update-pi.sh) instead.

Every pi release since 0.82 has a written migration record:
[`pi-migrations.md`](pi-setup/pi-migrations.md).

## The graveyard

16 packages were installed, used, and removed. `verify-patches.sh` fails if any
of them comes back.

| Package | Why it went |
|---|---|
| `@tomooshi/condensed-milk-pi` | reported failed git commands as successes |
| `pi-autoresearch` | its prompt guidelines changed mid-session, rewriting the cache |
| `pi-tasks` | array parameters arrived JSON-stringified; `task_plan` always failed |
| `pi-web-access` | every search provider key was rejected or rate-limited |
| `pi-context` | checkpoint spam; pi's own `/compact` covers the need |
| `pi-computer-use` | its GUI tools never registered |
| `pi-claude-bridge`, `claude-agent-sdk-pi` | replaced by native Anthropic + `pi-claude-code-use` |
| `@sting8k/pi-vcc` | redundant once native compaction landed |
| `lsp-pi`, `pi-powerline-footer`, `pi-anycopy` | installed where pi never loads them |
| `pi-gpt-config`, `pi-ask`, `pi-grok-cli`, `todos` | unused |

## Install

**Needs:** macOS (built and tested there), node ≥ 22.19, and pi itself:
`npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Homebrew, nvm and any other
npm prefix all work; the installer finds pi from the `pi` on your `PATH`.

**Default model:** Claude Opus 5.5 on a Claude Max subscription (`/login
anthropic` inside pi). To use something else, change `defaultProvider` and
`defaultModel` in [`pi-setup/settings.json`](pi-setup/settings.json).

**Optional, one feature each** (the installer tells you what is missing):

| | turns on |
|---|---|
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | cheap sub-agents (chad, finder, librarian, read_session, read_web_page); without it they run on your main model |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | `web_search` |
| `gh auth login` | the 7 GitHub tools |
| `ripgrep`, `trash`, `bun` | `grep`/`find`, safe deletes, the patch audit and tests |

```bash
./install.sh pi --dry-run   # read this first
./install.sh pi
```

The installer backs up everything it overwrites, including pi's own stock files
(kept as `*.stock` beside the patched ones). It installs nothing globally, and
ends by running [`verify-patches.sh`](pi-setup/verify-patches.sh), which prints
the exact fix for anything that did not land.

**After any pi or package update:**

```bash
bash pi-setup/update-pi.sh <version>   # updating pi itself; never pi update --self
bash pi-setup/verify-patches.sh        # after any pi install / package update
```

## Ghostty

The repo started as my Ghostty config, and it still ships one: 22 dark themes,
11 fonts, and `gt` / `gf` / `gc` switchers that preview live as you scroll.
`./install.sh ghostty`, details in [`ghostty/`](ghostty/README.md). Each half
installs on its own.
