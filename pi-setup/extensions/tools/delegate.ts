/**
 * delegate — spawn a sub-agent for an independent chunk of work.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 * ported from bdsqqq/dots `user/pi/packages/extensions/delegate/index.ts`
 * (MIT, commit e04b620), replacing our `task.ts`. adapted:
 *   - `@bds_pi/*` -> `./lib/*`, `typebox` -> `@sinclair/typebox`,
 *     `@earendil-works/*` -> `@mariozechner/*`
 *   - his DI wrapper / config plumbing dropped; tool lists are consts here,
 *     matching how finder/oracle/librarian are written in this repo
 *   - model and thinking level come from lib/agent-models.ts
 *   - `description` is optional with a derived fallback (see PARAMS below)
 *
 * WHAT IT ADDS OVER `Task`
 * continuation. a delegate child can be resumed by passing back the
 * `continueId` from its result, so a follow-up question costs one more turn
 * instead of re-establishing the entire context. `Task` always ran
 * `--no-session`, so every child was a dead end.
