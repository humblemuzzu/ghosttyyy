/**
 * chad tool tests — pin the read-only surface and the model policy.
 *
 * two properties matter more than the rest and are asserted from several
 * directions, because both fail SILENTLY:
 *
 *   1. no mutation tool reaches the child. `chad` is read-only by construction,
 *      not by prompt, and a tool quietly added to the allowlist would give it
 *      back the ability to write with nothing failing.
 *   2. the model is pinned. piSpawn copies the parent's model whenever the
 *      parent is not anthropic, so a chad launched from a kimi session would
 *      become kimi — same output shape, wrong agent, no error anywhere.
