/**
 * chad — a read-only deep research sub-agent.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR
 *
 * research at swarm scale. five or eight chads go out in one message, each on
 * its own question, and each returns a structured report instead of a pile of
 * file contents. the parent keeps its context for the work.
 *
 * WHY IT IS READ-ONLY
 *
 * two reasons, and the second is the one that shaped the tool surface.
 *
 * first: research is what a swarm is good at. six agents reading in parallel
 * compose; six agents writing in parallel need coordination our locks cannot
 * provide, because `lib/mutex.ts` is a module-level Map and every sub-agent is
 * a separate OS process.
 *
 * second: dropping `apply_patch` is only half a constraint. bash writes. so the
 * child also runs under the read-only bash policy (lib/read-only-bash.ts),
 * enforced in its own process, not requested in its prompt.
 *
