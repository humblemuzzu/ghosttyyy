/**
 * tool-contract tests — the tool spec must be self-describing and internally
 * consistent, so a model never has to read our source to learn how to call us.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * measured, in a cold session: asked to launch two librarians and one oracle,
 * the model first ran `ls` on the tools directory, then grepped for
 * "parameters|Type.Object|Type.String", then read librarian.ts and oracle.ts —
 * roughly eight discovery calls before any real work, and it would have done
 * the same in every new session.
 *
 * it behaved correctly. the spec was contradictory:
 *   - the wire schema said `required: []` while the parameter description said
 *     "REQUIRED." models treat JSON Schema `required` as machine-truth and
 *     prose as advisory, so the contradiction made the whole spec suspect.
 *   - librarian's description discussed "what repositories you want to
 *     understand" while exposing no repository parameter, even though the seven
 *     github tools beside it all take one.
 *
 * these tests encode the fix as invariants. they are deliberately generic: any
 * tool added later is held to the same contract.
