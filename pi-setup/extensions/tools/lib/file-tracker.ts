 * one creation within the same tool call, whose bytes are identical. Requiring
 * uniqueness means a batch that moves one file and deletes another unrelated
 * one will not pair them by accident; requiring byte equality means a delete
 * and an unrelated create cannot pair at all. When the batch is ambiguous this
 * returns null and the caller reverts only what was asked for — a partial undo
