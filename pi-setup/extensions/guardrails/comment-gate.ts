/**
 * Comment gate — decides whether an apply_patch call adds too much commentary.
 *
 * Pure. No I/O, no pi imports, so the whole decision is testable without a
 * session. index.ts owns the hook; this file owns the judgement.
 *
 * Two independent triggers, because one number cannot catch both offences:
 *
 *   RUN    a single unbroken comment block over MAX_RUN lines. This is the
 *          30-line file header above a 5-line const. A ratio check misses it
 *          whenever the rest of the file is long enough to dilute it.
 *   RATIO  comments outnumber code by more than MAX_RATIO across the change.
 *          This is death by a thousand one-liners, where no single run is big.
 *
 * Everything unrecognised passes. A gate that guesses wrong blocks real work,
 * and the cost of a missed essay is one rewrite while the cost of a false
 * block is the tool being turned off.
